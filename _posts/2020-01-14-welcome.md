# Resnet18!!!
In my exploration of deep learing through the fastai course, I have come across the resnet18 model and used it to tune my own models. My goal with this post was to develop a better understanding of the resnet18 model and deepen my understanding of deep learning as a whole.

## What is ResNet18?

ResNet18 belongs to the ResNet (Residual Neural Network) family, which was introduced by Kaiming He et al. in their seminal paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" in 2015. The "18" in ResNet18 refers to its depth, specifically its number of layers. Despite its relatively modest size compared to later iterations like ResNet50 or ResNet101, ResNet18 packs a formidable punch in terms of performance and efficiency.

## The Power of Skip Connections

At the heart of ResNet's success lies the concept of skip connections or residual connections. Unlike traditional deep neural networks, where each layer directly feeds into the next, ResNet introduces shortcuts that allow information to bypass certain layers. These shortcuts mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the network to effectively train much deeper architectures [1].

## Applications and Impact

ResNet18, along with its larger variants, has become a go-to choice for various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Its robustness, efficiency, and ease of training make it a versatile tool for both researchers and practitioners alike.

Beyond its practical applications, ResNet18 has had a profound impact on the development of subsequent architectures. Many state-of-the-art models, such as DenseNet, Wide ResNet, and SENet, draw inspiration from ResNet's fundamental insights, further propelling the field of deep learning forward.
